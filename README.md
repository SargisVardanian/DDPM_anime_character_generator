# DDPM_anime_character_generator
This is my DDPM implementation for generation anime character faces. I use neural networks such as convolutional networks, attention mechanisms. I wrote the code in Pytorch and Numpy. Training is processed on Apple Sillicon "MPS". I got the data set from Kaggel, here is the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset
